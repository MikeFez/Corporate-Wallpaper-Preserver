# Billy Mays here!

Are you tired of coworkers changing your wallpaper when you step away from your desk? Did you develop PTSD from Richard Simmons in pink 80's workout attire assulting your eyes when you minimized that Chrome tab?

Fear no more! Introducing the Corporate Wallpaper Preserver!

Watch that sparkle in their eye diminish back to a blank, souless stare in a matter of seconds.

# How To Use (Windows only for now)
1) Set your wallpaper
2) Copy the path to the wallpaper to the script
3) Launch the program in windowless mode upon boot
4) Kick back and watch as absolutely nothing happens at all
5) Go to the bathroom
6) Return to your desk, listening for the child-like giggling of nearby coworkers. (Goddamn it Steve, you sound like an 8 year old girl scout)
7) Minimize your maximized tab to observe nothing has changed, and it never will. Become sad as you realize this saying also accurately describes your ignored New Years resolution
8) Question if they even touched your computer, of if you're just paranoid enough to download and configure this script
8) Spend the rest of the day wondering why you don't just lock your goddamn computer
